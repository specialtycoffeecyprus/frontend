<h1>About Specialty Coffee in Cyprus</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Vladimir and I really like delicious coffee.</p>
<p>Therefore, I made a website so that coffee lovers could easily find the nearest Specialty coffee shop in Cyprus. I have personally visited every coffee shop and confirm the excellent taste of coffee.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are not many Specialty coffee shops on the island, but I hope that my site will help the development of coffee culture.</p>

<h2>What is Specialty Coffee?</h2>
<p>The term "<em>Specialty coffee</em>" or "<em>Speciality coffee</em>" is used to refer to coffee that is graded 80 points or above on a 100 point scale by a certified coffee taster (<abbr title="Specialty Coffee Association">SCA</abbr>) or by a licensed Q Grader (<abbr title="Chartered Quality Institute">CQI</abbr>).</p>
<p>Typically, speciality coffee is grown at high altitudes, with much care and attention from the farmer. From there, it is sold at a premium to coffee traders, or direct to roasters.</p>
<p>The roasters then create custom profiles for each coffee, enhancing and highlighting their natural flavours.</p>
<p>Baristas then use the carefully grown and roasted coffee to produce quality beverages, often with high precision and specialised equipment.</p>
<p>The main resourse about Specialty Coffee is <a href="https://sca.coffee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Specialty Coffee Association</a>.</p>
